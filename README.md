# Qiskit-Implementation-of-Quantum-Algorithms-on-Open-Dynamical-Evolution-of-Quantum-systems
This Qiskit code is part of a project that extends the work of Zixuan H., Rongxin X. and Sabre K. to simulate the quantum circuit and calculate some important statistics of said algorithm

The code is ambigiously named. An update will follow which will add in the paper a section explaining the code.
